# Restaurant Sales Analysis üçΩÔ∏è

## Project Overview  
This project, developed in **Google Colab**, analyzes a restaurant's sales data stored in a **SQLite3 database**.  
The analysis uncovers insights about:  

- Most popular products by quantity and revenue  
- Time-based revenue patterns (hourly, daily, monthly, yearly)  
- Common dish combinations for potential promotions  
- Menu optimization opportunities

## Data Sources  
The project uses a SQLite3 database (`db.sqlite3`) with three main tables:  
- **restaurant_orderitem** ‚Äì order items, quantities, links to orders and products (~74k rows)  
- **restaurant_product** ‚Äì product names and prices (~250 rows)  
- **restaurant_order** ‚Äì order timestamps (~13k rows)  

---

## Key Features  
- **Database Exploration**: inspection of relational structure and foreign keys  
- **Sales Performance Analysis**: identifying top-performing products  
- **Temporal Analysis**: hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly revenue trends  
- **Combination Analysis**: discovering frequently paired menu items  
- **Visualizations**: charts and graphs to represent findings

## Main Findings  

### Product Performance  
- Higher-priced main dishes (e.g., Chicken Tikka Masala) drive the most revenue  
- Low-cost sides (e.g., Plain Papadum) are ordered most frequently  
- Sales volume ‚â† profit contribution  

### Revenue Patterns  
- Peak hours: **17:00, 18:00, 20:00** (highest at 18:00)  
- Peak days: **Friday and Saturday**; Sunday also strong  
- Seasonal trends: **May‚ÄìJuly and December** are top months  
- Annual: steady growth until 2018, decline in 2019  

### Dish Combinations  
- Identified top 10 most frequent dish pairings  
- Avg. order size ‚âà **5.6 items**  
- Opportunities for combo meal promotions

## Visualizations  
The notebook includes:  
- **Pie charts** ‚Äì top products by quantity & revenue  
- **Bar charts** ‚Äì temporal analysis (hourly, daily, monthly, yearly)  
- **Bar charts** ‚Äì common dish combinations
